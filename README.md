# more-inactive-state-DP-VS-DP2

The primary objective of this project is to simulate Directed Percolation (DP) using the Domany-Kinzel model. Specifically, I explored two sets of rules: one assuming a single absorbing state and the other assuming multiple absorbing states (two in this case). The goal is to investigate the critical behavior of the system and calculate the associated critical exponents.
